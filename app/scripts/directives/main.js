/**
 * In the 'directives' directory, put one directory and/or file.js per directive module, as in 'features'.
 * See the docs in features/main.
 *
 * We recommend that you use directories, as you can then put tests, templates and/or less stylesheets close to the
 * directive's JS code.
 *
 * This app module is suited for cross-feature directives. If you want to create a feature-specific directive,
 * define it in it's feature module.
 *
 * In this file, require your directive JS file. The corresponding AngularJS modules will be automatically loaded
 * on app startup (if you use ezweb.start()). Make sure you name your modules 'app.directives.*'.
